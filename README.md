---------------------------------------------------------------
From the indiducal project guide, suggested idea number 4, used as basis/inspiration for developing this project:

 External User’s Goal:
 The user seeks accessible, beginner-friendly information on mental health, including how to recognize 
common issues and manage stress, presented in a supportive and organised layout.
 Site Owner’s Goal:
 The site owner wants to create a welcoming webpage that provides basic mental health information 
using a clean and supportive design. The focus is on using HTML and CSS with Bootstrap to create a 
calming and well-organised user experience.
