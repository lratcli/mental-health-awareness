My rough working plan at the start:

# mental-health-awareness
Code Institute Flagstone Project

**Project goal**

The goal of this website is to provide a calm space where a user can access access information on common mental health issues. The site is to be accessible and responsive, and be a static website using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap libraries and external font styles where appropirate.

**Objectives are to:**

  - have a responsive, mobile first design
  - have a simple and logical navigation system
  - meet all accessibility best practices
  - have a simple, clutter free layout
  - use calming imagery and colours to encourge feelings of peacefulness
  - provide easy access to external resources that may be useful both in the moment or in the longer term

**Target audience**

- users who are feel they may be suffereing from stress
- users who feel they may be suffering from other mental health issues, and need information
- users who are concerned about another, and are seeking information

**Services**
- offer fast and convenient access to a range of unseful information
- provide direct links to embedded video guides on relaxation
- allow users to sign up to a newsletter providing ongoing updates of useful information directly

## User Stories ##

These were generated using Copilot, refining prompts along the way to get more specific and relevant user stories.

From the indiducal project guide, suggested idea number 4, used as basis/inspiration for developing this project:

 External User’s Goal:
 The user seeks accessible, beginner-friendly information on mental health, including how to recognize 
common issues and manage stress, presented in a supportive and organised layout.
 Site Owner’s Goal:
 The site owner wants to create a welcoming webpage that provides basic mental health information 
using a clean and supportive design. The focus is on using HTML and CSS with Bootstrap to create a 
calming and well-organised user experience.
